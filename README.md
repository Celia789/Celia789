- 👋 Hi, I’m @Celia789
- 👀 I’m interested in many things, but I'm working with seismic data these days
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to properly code, I've started learning python 1 month ago
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a simple code I've tried written which is almost working but not quite yet haha
- 📫 How to reach me ... on Github I guess?
